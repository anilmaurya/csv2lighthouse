Import tickets from a CSV file into Lightouse.
----------

For the moment, the CSV file can only have 3 fields:

    title,description,tags

in that order and with no spaces between header each header name.

Requires the [Lighthouse API](http://github.com/Caged/lighthouse-api/tree/master). Inspired by [http://tech.howcast.com/?p=12](http://tech.howcast.com/?p=12)
